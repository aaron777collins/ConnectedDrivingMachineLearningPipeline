A0 means legitimate

[10-28 11:18 a.m.] Aaron Collins
Anything else represents the type of attack

[10-28 11:19 a.m.] Aaron Collins
First num is the receiver ID (type 3 messages are those received from others)

[10-28 11:19 a.m.] Aaron Collins
Receiver id means this is the carâ€™s ID (vehicle 9)

[10-28 11:20 a.m.] Aaron Collins
For example: vehicle 9 is not an attacker because it is A0

[10-28 11:20 a.m.] Aaron Collins
Vehicle 15 is doing some type of attack because it is not A0 (11 is a type of attack)

[10-28 11:32 a.m.] Aaron Collins
No noise (maybe try with?), no Z, no senderID and no senderpseudo
